 Class: FIRep
 
 Description: Computes and stores an FI-Rep of the hom_dim^{th} homology module
 of a (possibly multicritical) bifiltered simplicial complex.  Constructor takes 
 as input a BifiltrationData object, a representation of the FI_Rep obtained 
 directly from text input, or (at least for now) a presentation. In the future, 
 we probably won't need the constructor taking a presentation. The constructor 
 taking a bifiltration data object can handle the multicritical case, using a
 simple "trick" described in a paper of Scolamiero, Chacholski, and Vaccarino.

 
 Structs: VectorHash, deref_equal_fn
 
 Description:  To construct an FIRep from a BifiltrationData object, we 
 construct hash tables whose keys are pointers to simplices.  These are used, 
 respectively, to define the hash function and to compare compare two keys for 
 equality.
