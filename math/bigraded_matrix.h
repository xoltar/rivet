 Class: BigradedMatrix
 
 Description: This is a wrapper class which stores a MapMatrix
 and an associated IndexMatrix.  Most important method is kernel().
 Used when columns are sorted in colex order of their bigrades of appearance.
   
 
 Class: BigradedMatrixLex
 
 Description: This is a similar wrapper class which stores a MapMatrix and an 
 associated IndexMatrixLex.  Used when columns are sorted in lex order of their
