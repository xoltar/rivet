 Class: Presentation

 Description: Stores a presentation of a 2-D persistence module.
 Main constructor takes an FIRep as input; destroys the FIRep as a side effect.
 Also has a method for minimizing a presentation, using only column-operations.
 Whereas constructing the presentation uses lazy heaps,
 minimization requires to sort the entries of the columns and
 perform binary searches for specific entries.

    the entries using binary search.  Columns are added in a way that maintains 
    the order.
     
    When we call minimize(), we implcitly are removing rows from the matrix.  
    Thus, in our column sparse setting, after the initial minimization, the 
    entries of the matrices are correct up to an order-preserving reindexing.  
    To complete the minimization, the code then performs a reindexing of the 
    entire matrix.
