 Classes: MapMatrix and related classes.
 
 Description: The classes introduces here store a column sparse matrix with Z/2Z 
 coefficients, and provide operations for persistence calculations. The original 
 version of this class was based on a custom linked list data structure for 
 columns.  This updated version does away with linked lists, and instead 
 represents matrices using a modified version of the class vector_heap from the 
 PHAT library, which stores columns as lazy heaps.  Here "lazy" means that 
 multiple copies of an element are allowed to live in the heap.  See the PHAT 
 paper for details.
 
 This file introduces four related classes:
 * MapMatrix_Base provides the basic structures and functionality; it is the 
   parent class and is not meant to be instantiated directly.
 * MapMatrix : MapMatrix_Base stores matrices in a column-sparse format, 
   designed for basic persistence calcuations, and computations of bigraded 
   betti numbers / presentations.
 * MapMatrix_Perm : MapMatrix adds functionality for row and column 
   permutations; it is designed for the reduced matrices of vineyard updates.
 * MapMatrix_RowPriority_Perm : MapMatrix_Base stores matrices in a row-sparse 
   format with row and column permutations; it is designed for the 
   upper-triangular matrices of vineyard updates.

/*
 
 TODO [Mike]: Preliminary computational experiments indicate that using lazy 
 heaps makes RIVET significantly faster. However, the orginazation I have 
 introduced is probably not optimizal.  Matthew's version of the MapMatrix 
 hierarchy had 4 matrix classes.  This update still has those four, plus the 
 classes vector_heap_mod (a modification of PHAT's vector_heap class), and 
 vector_heap_perm : vector_heap_mod.  That seems to be a bit much, and the way 
 the code is written, it has been a pain to add additional functionality, 
 because vector_heap_mod and MapMatrix typically both need to be modified.  
 On top of this, minimizing a presention uses a matrix with sorted columns, and 
 it may be appropriate to have a special place for such matrices in the class 
 structure, especially since some different methods are used with these.
 
 The structure should be revisited.  Here are some specific ideas for cleaning 
 up the structure:
 
 -Get rid of the MapMatrix_Base class.  This seems to no longer be a heplful 
  abstraction, since vector_heap_mod now plays the role of the base class.
 
 -It may be wise to make the vector_heap_mod object public, in order to reduce 
  the number of wrapper classes.
 
 -Revisit the names of the functions here, in relation to the functions in 
  vector_heap_mod.
 
 -Perhaps the use of the PHAT integer typedef "index" vs. ordinary int should be 
  more systematic.
