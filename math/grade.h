 Struct: Grade
 
 Description: Pair of coordinates specifying grade of appearance,
 together with an operator < which compares COLEXICOGRAPHICALLY,
 i.e., first by y-coordinate,  then by x-coordinate.
 NOTE: This Struct appeared earlier in bifiltration_data.h.  Since the same struct is
 useful elsewhere, it is better in its own file.
